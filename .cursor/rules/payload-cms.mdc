# Payload CMS Structure

This project uses Payload CMS with the following structure:

## Collections
- Collections are defined in [src/collections](mdc:src/collections)
- Each collection has its own file (e.g., [Users](mdc:src/collections/Users/index.ts), [Teams](mdc:src/collections/Teams.ts))
- User collection includes role-based access control with `checkRole` function

## Configuration
- Main Payload config is in [src/payload.config.ts](mdc:src/payload.config.ts)
- Global configurations are in [src/globalConfigs](mdc:src/globalConfigs)

## Admin Interface
- Custom admin components are in [src/components/BeforeDashboard](mdc:src/components/BeforeDashboard)
- Admin routes are under [src/app/(payload)/admin](mdc:src/app/(payload)/admin)

## API Routes
- REST API endpoints are handled by [src/app/(payload)/api/[...slug]/route.ts](mdc:src/app/(payload)/api/[...slug]/route.ts)
- GraphQL endpoint is at [src/app/(payload)/api/graphql/route.ts](mdc:src/app/(payload)/api/graphql/route.ts)
